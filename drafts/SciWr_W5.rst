Video 5.1: Tables and Figures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




Video 5.2: Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Results =/= Raw Data
""""""""""""""""""""

The results section should not repeat the raw data shown in the figures.

- Summarize what the data show

  - Point out simple relationships

    - What is the take home message?

  - Describe big picture trends

    - What are the key points you'd like your readers to glean from the raw data?

  - Cite figures and tables that present supporting data


**Examples:**

- Good: Over the course of treatment, topiramate was significantly more effective than placebo at improving drinking outcomes on drinking days, percentage of days abstinent, and log plasma - glutamyl transferase ratio (Table 3).

- Good: The total suicide rate for Australian men and women did not change between 1991 and 2000 because marked decreases in older men and women (Table 1) were offset by increases in younger adults, especially younger men.

- Bad: The characteristics of the bad witches and the good witches are shown in Table 1. There was a significant difference in age between the groups. The mean age of the bad witches was 45 ‡ 5; and the mean age of the good witches was 36 ‡ 6. There was no significant difference in gender between the groups, with the bad witches having 85% females and the good witches having 83% females. BMI was not significantly different between the groups, which both had normal BMIs. Systolic blood pressure and exercise were significantly different. The bad witches had a mean blood pressure of 140 ‡ 10, whereas the good witches had a mean blood pressure of 120 + 9. Estimated daily exercise was higher in the good witches (60 £ 30) than the bad witches (30 + 20). Employment was not significantly different between the two groups

  - Improved: The witches were, on average, lean and predominantly female (Table 1). Bad witches were significantly older, had higher blood pressures, exercised less, and were more likely to smoke than good witches. More had witches wore unemployed hut this difference did not reach statistical significance.


What verb tense do I use?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use past tense for completed actions:

 - We *found* that...
 - The average reaction time *was*...
 - Women *were* more likely to...
 - Men *smoked* more cigarettes than...

Use the represent tense for assertions that continue to be true, such as what the tables show, what you believe, and what the data suggest:

 - Figure 1 *shows*...
 - The findings *confirm*...
 - The data *suggest*...
 - We believe that this *shows*...

**Example:**
Information **was** available for 7766 current cigarette smokers. Of these, 1216 (16%) **were classified** as hardcore smokers. Table 1 **gives** characteristics of all the smokers. The most striking difference **was** that hardcore smokers **were** about 10 years older on average and **tended** to be more dependent on tobacco. Significantly more hardcore smokers **had** manual occupations, **lived** in rented accommodation, and **had** **completed** their full time education by the age of 16 years. There **was** no difference by sex.


Use active voice!

- More lively!
- Can replace "we" with:

  - Study participants
  - Experimental outcomes
  - Findings
  - Data models

**Examples:**

To test whether it was appropriate to exclude a measure of cigarette dependence from our criteria for defining hardcore smoking, **we compared** attitudes and beliefs by dependence in hardcore and other smokers (table 4). For most items, **beliefs were** similar in low and high dependence hardcore smokers but strikingly different from those of other smokers. For example, almost 60% of both low and high dependency non-hardcore **smokers agreed** that improved health would be a major benefit from quitting whereas among hardcore smokers only 27% of low dependency and 32% of high dependency smokers agreed. Similar **differentiation** in beliefs by hardcore smoking status, but not dependence level, **emerged** for other items, especially those related to health.




Video 5.2: Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The discussion section inverts the structure of the introduction. Start with the most narrow piece of information and then broaden:

* Answer the question asked
* Support your conclusion (your data, others' data)
* Defend your conclusion (anticipated criticisms)

  * Limitations, caveats

* Give the big-picture take-home message

In summary, the discussion section should impart what your results mean and why anyone (incl. those outside your niche research field) should care.


Template for discussion section:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Key finding (answer to the question(s) being asked in the introduction)

  - Start with: "We found that..."
  - Explain what the data mean
  - State if the findings are novel

- Key secondary findings
- Context

  - Give possible mechanisms or pathways
  - Compare your results with other people's results
  - Discuss how your findings support or challenge the paradigm

- Strength and Limitations

  - Anticipate the readers' questions/criticisms
  - Explain why your results are robust

- What's next

  - Recommend confirmatory studies ("Needs to be confirmed...")
  - Point out unanswered questions and future directions

- The "so what?": implicate, speculate, recommend

  - Give the big-picture (human) implications of basic science findings
  - Tell the readers why they should care

- Strong Conclusion (could be a separate section beyond discussion)

  - Restate your main finding
  - Give a final take-home message


Discussion Section Tips:
""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Showcase good Writing

  - Use active voice
  - Tell it like a story

- Start and end with findings

  - "We found that..."

- Don't travel too far with the data

  - Focus on what your data do prove, not what you hoped they would prove

- Focus on limitations

  - Focus on limitations that matter, not generic ones
  - Specific to this study and not generally others

- Make sure your take-home message is clear and consistent

The Discussion: Verb Tense
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Past tense

  - "We found that..."
  - "Subjects may have experienced..."
  - "Miller et al. found..."

- Present tense:

  - "The greater weight loss suggests"
  - "The explanation for this difference is not clear..."
  - "Potential explanations include..."


Video 5.4: Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Give a clear overview of what was done
- Give enough information someone could replicate the study (e.g., a recipe)
- Be complete, but make life easier for the reader

  - Break up your methods into sub-sections with sub-headings
  - Display methods in a flow diagram or table, rather than text

- You may use jargon, passive voice


What to include in the methods section?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Materials
- Participants/subjects

  - Animals: state that the research was approved by the appropriate committee at your institution
  - Humans: same as above

- Experimental protocol/study design
- Measurements

  - How were the dependent and independent variables measured

- Analyses


Refer to previously used methods

- "... as previously described (citation)"


Verb tense
""""""""""

- Past tense
- Present tense for how the data is described

Passive vs Active Voice
"""""""""""""""""""""""

You can switch between the two depending on what you want to emphasize.

- "Oral temperatures were measured..." vs "We measured oral temperatures"


Video 5.5: Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview:

- Typically 3 paragraphs long (recommended 2 to 5)

  - Paragraphs should be short

- Should not be an exhaustive review of your general topic

  - Should focus on the specific hypothesis/aim of the study
  - Write for a general audience

- Do no answer the research question (no results, implications)
- Summarize at a high leveld

  - Leave detailed descriptions, speculations, and criticisms of particular studies for the discussion


Standard Format
"""""""""""""""

- Paragraph 1: Background, known information
- P2: Knowledge gap, unknown information
- P3: Hypothesis, question, purpose statement
- P3: Approach, plan of attack, proposed solution
- P3: Why your experimental approach is new and different and important (fills gaps)
