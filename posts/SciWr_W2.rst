Scientific Writing Coursera Course: Week 2
==========================================

Previous Week Review
--------------------

Last week, I started the Coursera course Writing in the Sciences, and `blogging <SciWr_W1U1v1.html>`_ about the course. The first week covered "decluttering" our writing:

- Pay attention to vague words
- Watch out for jargon. Simplify as much as possible
- Careful of acronyms and initialisms
- Be mindful of using passive voice
- Place verbs early on in sentence

Week 2 will build off of these lessons and focus on using verbs more effectively.


Week 2
------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

- Active voice
- Writing with verbs
  - Strong verbs
  - Avoiding turning verbs into nouns
  - Sentence subjects and verbs close to one another
