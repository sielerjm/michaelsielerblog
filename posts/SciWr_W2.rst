Scientific Writing Coursera Course: Week 2
==========================================

Previous Week Review
--------------------

Last week, I started the Coursera course Writing in the Sciences, and `blogging <SciWr_W1U1v1.html>`_ about the course. The first week covered "decluttering" our writing:

- Pay attention to vague words
- Watch out for jargon. Simplify as much as possible
- Careful of acronyms and initialisms
- Be mindful of using passive voice
- Place verbs early on in sentence

Week 2 will build off of these lessons and focus on using verbs more effectively.


Week 2
------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

- Active voice
- Writing with verbs
  - Strong verbs
  - Avoiding turning verbs into nouns
  - Sentence subjects and verbs close to one another


Video 2.1: Use the active voice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**What is the active voice?**

Follows the format: subject + verb + object.

- She throws the ball.

  - Agent: she
  - Verb: throws
  - Recipient: the ball

- Martha will drive the car.
- He made mistakes.

**What is the passive voice?**

The passive voice inverts the agent/recipient relationship:

- The ball is thrown by her.

  - Recipient: ball
  - Verb: thrown
  - Agent: her

- The car will be driven by Martha.
- Mistakes were made by The President.

The agent can be obscured in passive voice by dropping it entirely, for example:

- Mistakes were made [by The President]

**Recognizing a passive verb**

- Passive verb = a form of the verb "to be" + the past participle of the main verb
- The main verb must be a transitive verb (that is, take an object).

**Examples of passive voice**

- My first visit to Boson will always be remembered by me.

  - Recipient: my first visit to Boston
  - Passive verb: will always be
  - Agent: me (at the end of the sentence)
  - Active: I will always remember my first visit to Boston.

- She is loved

  - Recipient: She
  - Passive verb: is loved
  - Agent: none
  - Active: He loves her.

- Cigarette ads were designed to appeal especially to children.

  - Recipient: children
  - Passive verb: were designed
  - Agent: none
  - Active: We designed the cigarette ads to appeal especially to children.

    - "We" is now the agent, the responsibile party.

**Turning passive into active**

To turn the passive back into the active voice, you need to identify the agent, recipient and verb.
- Who does what to whom?

  - Who does the action? Who had the action done to them?


Practice:
"""""""""

By applying a high resolution, 90 degree bending magnet downstream of the laser electron interaction region, the spectrum of the electron beams *could be observed*.

- Agent: none
-
  - Add "We could observe" to the front of the sentence.

- verb: could be observed
- Recipient: the spectrum of the electron beams


------

Increased promoter occupancy and transcriptional activation of p21 and other target genes were observed.

- Agent: none

  - Add "We observed" to the front of the sentence.

- verb: were observed
- Recipient: Increased promoter occupancy and transcriptional activation of p21 and other target genes


------

The activation of C++ channels is induced by the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ stores.

- Agent: endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ stores
- verb: is induced
- Recipient: Ca++ channels
- Active: Depleted endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ stores induce Ca++ channel activation.

  - Better: Depleting Ca++ from the endoplasmic reticulum activates Ca++ channels


-------

Additionally, it was found that pre-treatment with antibiotics increased the number of super-shedders, while immunosuppression did not.

- Agent: Pre-treatment with antibiotics
- verb: increased
- Recipient: super-shedders
- Active: We found that pre-treatment with antibiotics increased the number of super-sheddres, while immunosuppresion did not.

  - Better: Pre-treating the mice with antibiotics increased the number of super-shedders while immunosuppresion did not.

**Advantages of the active voice**

1 Emphasizes author responsibility
2 Improves readability
3 Reduces ambiuity
