Scientific Writing Coursera Course: Week 1
==========================================

To improve my scientific writing skills, I've enrolled in a `Coursera course <https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/home/welcome>`_ taught by Dr. Dr. Kristin Sainani.

I'll be sharing my notes, thoughts and writing exercises in a series of blog posts.

Week 1
------

Video 1.1: Introduction; Principles of effective writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dr. Sainani introduced the course, gave an overview of the course material, and some brief principles of effective writing.


Video 1.2: Examples of what not to do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Questions to ask yourself:

- Is this sentence easy to understand?
- Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?

.. note:: Science should be enjoyable and fun to read!

More questions:

- Is this sentence readable?
- Is it written to inform or to obscure?

Nouns slow down reading, verbs activate reading.

- convert nouns to verbs when possible

  - "Selection" to "select"
  - "production" to "to produce"
  - "recycling" to "to recycle"

Course Themes:

- Complex ideas don't require complex language
- Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read


Video 1.3: Overview, principles of effective writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Things to watch out for in your writing**

- Pay attention to vague words.
- Physiologic? What exactly does this mean?
- Molecular species? Which species?
- Watch out for jargon. Simplify as much as possible.
- Careful of acronyms and initialisms.

  - Unless they are standard terms. Most readers won't know what they mean

- Be mindful of using passive voice.
- Place verb early on in sentence

**Overview of specific principles of Writing**
- Cut unncessary words and phrases; learn to part with your words
- Use the active voice (subject + verb + object)
- Write with verbs: use strong verbs, avoid turning burbs into nouns, and don't bury the main verb

- Unnecessary Jargon and acronyms

  - Muscular and cardiorespiratory performance
  - Gliomagensis
  - miR

- Repetitive words or phrases

  - illustrate/demonstrate
  - challenges/difficulties
  - successful solutions


- Adverbs

  - very, really, quite, basically, generally, etc.

Before

    As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 Up, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy.

After

    Figure 2 shows that a return kinetic energy lower than 3.2 Up yields two electron trajectories.
