Scientific Writing Coursera Course: Week 1
==========================================

To improve my scientific writing skills, I've enrolled in a `Coursera course <https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/home/welcome>`_ taught by Dr. Dr. Kristin Sainani.

I'll be sharing my notes, thoughts and writing exercises in a series of blog posts.

Week 1
------

Video 1.1: Introduction; Principles of effective writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dr. Sainani introduced the course, gave an overview of the course material, and some brief principles of effective writing.


Video 2.1: Examples of what not to do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Questions to ask yourself:

- Is this sentence easy to understand?
- Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?

.. note:: Science should be enjoyable and fun to read!

More questions:

- Is this sentence readable?
- Is it written to inform or to obscure?

Nouns slow down reading, verbs activate reading.

- convert nouns to verbs when possible
    - "Selection" to "select"
    - "production" to "to produce"
    - "recycling" to "to recycle"

Course Themes:

- Complex ideas don't require complex language
- Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read
