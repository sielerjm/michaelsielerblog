Scientific Writing Coursera Course: Week 1
==========================================

To improve my scientific writing skills, I've enrolled in a `Coursera course <https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/home/welcome>`_ taught by Dr. Dr. Kristin Sainani.

I'll be sharing my notes, thoughts and writing exercises in a series of blog posts.

Week 1
------

Video 1.1: Introduction; Principles of effective writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dr. Sainani introduced the course, gave an overview of the course material, and some brief principles of effective writing.


Video 1.2: Examples of what not to do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Questions to ask yourself:

- Is this sentence easy to understand?
- Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?

.. note:: Science should be enjoyable and fun to read!

More questions:

- Is this sentence readable?
- Is it written to inform or to obscure?

Nouns slow down reading, verbs activate reading.

- convert nouns to verbs when possible
-
  - "Selection" to "select"
  - "production" to "to produce"
  - "recycling" to "to recycle"

Course Themes:

- Complex ideas don't require complex language
- Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read


Video 1.3: Overview, principles of effective writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Things to watch out for in your writing**
-Pay attention to vague words.
- Physiologic? What exactly does this mean?
- Molecular species? Which species?
- Watch out for jargon. Simplify as much as possible.
- Careful of acronyms and initialisms.
  - Unless they are standard terms. Most readers won't know what they mean.
- Be mindful of using passive voice.
- Place verb early on in sentence

**Overview of specific principles of Writing**
- Cut unncessary words and phrases; learn to part with your words
- Use the active voice (subject + verb + object)
- Write with verbs: use strong verbs, avoid turning burbs into nouns, and don't bury the main verb


Video 1.4: Cut the clutter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before:

    As it is well known, increased athletic activity has been related to a profile of lower cardiovascular risk, lower blood pressure levels, and improved muscular and cardio-respiratory performance.


After:

    Increased athletic activity is associates with lower cardiovascular risk, blood pressure, and improves fitness.


Before

    "The experimental demonstration is the first of its kind and is a proof of principle for the concept of laser driven particle acceleration in a structure loaded vacuum."


After:

    This experiment provides a proof of principle of laser-driven particle acceleration in a structure-loaded vacuum.


Cut unnecessary words
- Be vigilant and ruthless
- Try the sentence without the extra words and see how it's better-conveys the same idea with more power.
